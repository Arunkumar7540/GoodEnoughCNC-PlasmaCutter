							<p>The Chinese BMF CUT 50M plasma cutter packs more than enough punch to cleanly cut up to 5 mm sheet metal (10 mm max cut). Additionally a compressor and torch height controller is needed. You can replace with plasma of your choise.</p>

		                <p>The main guideline for building a CNC Plasma was its easy construction and material, avaliable from the local hardware store with use of only basic hand tools. The entire frame is made from a rectangular 40x40 mm pipes which simultaneously serve as guides for the X and Y axis. For trolleys we used 100x100mm rectangular pipes which are embedded by standard 608ZZ bearings. The drive was carried out with a timing belt, which is driven by Nema stepper 23 No. It has been shown that for the chosen design we are able to achieve good accuracy and aligment of parts during construction of the system and at the same time ensures a very good accuracy and repeatability during its operation. Z axis is built in a way that offers maximum rigidy to a plasma gun and minimalizes vibration during operation.</p>

		                <p>We constructed CNC plasma which can be assembled by people with very little building experience. There is no need for complex and expensive tools. Majority of construction can be build from steel plates and beams with basic operation like drilling and cutting. Al plastic parts are 3D printed. We prepared extensive instructions for assembly and guides for properly drilling holes and cutting steel profiles.   </p>
